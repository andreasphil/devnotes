title: JSNation 2025, JSON modules, CSS if()
---

- I've heard many good things about **[JSNation 2025.](https://jsnation.com)** Recordings of their talks are now available [online.](https://gitnation.com/events/jsnation-2025) My recommendations:
  - [Frontend's lost decade and the performance inequality gap](https://gitnation.com/contents/project-fugu-bringing-hardware-capabilities-to-the-web-safely) by Alex Russel: a look at the impact of nowadays' development practices on users, and how to build performant and resilient websites.
  - [Vite and the Future of JavaScript Tooling](https://gitnation.com/contents/vite-and-the-future-of-javascript-tooling) by Evan You: a first look at _Vite+_, the Vite team's attempt at building a Go-style all-in-one toolchain for JavaScript, including building, testing, linting, and formatting. Very excited about this!
  - [The New Defaults of the Modern Web](https://gitnation.com/contents/the-new-defaults-of-the-modern-web) by Jeremias Menichelli: reviewing defaults and best practices when starting new web projects today.

- Besides the talk he gave at JSNation, Alex Russel also attended React Summit, and reflects about the differences on his [blog:](https://infrequently.org/2025/06/conferences-clarity-and-smokescreens/)

> Near as I can tell, the schedule of React Summit mirrors the content of other recent and pending React conferences in that these are not engineering conferences; they are marketing events. [...] Conferences crystallise consensus about which problems matter, and React Summit succeeded in projecting a clear perspective---namely that it's time to party like it's 2013.

- **Vapor Mode,** a Svelte-like compiler for Vue components that promises dramatically improved performance, has been [merged](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/12359) into Vue core and should land as a preview with the next release.

- [**Nuxt is joining Vercel.**](https://nuxtlabs.com/) Part of me is slightly nervous about Vercel "owning" so many frameworks (Next, Nuxt, Svelte). But for the Nuxt team itâ€™s a good chance to secure funding, [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) will be available for free, and Svelte seems to be doing just fine. So I'm cautiously optimistic ðŸ¤ž

- The [**CookieStore API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore), a more modern and ergonomic API for handling cookies, is now available in all browsers.

- JavaScript now natively supports [**importing JSON as modules.**](https://web.dev/blog/json-imports-baseline-newly-available) If you're wondering about the funky syntax, those are called [import attributes](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/import-attributes-in-javascript) (and there are more to come).

- [CSS is getting an **`if()` function.**](https://css-tricks.com/lightly-poking-at-the-css-if-function-in-chrome-137/) While I can see how this might be useful, I'm not sold on the syntax. It looks kinda messy, especially if you have more than one rule in a class using it. Early days for now, but this will be coming to all browsers eventually.

- [Experimenting with **no-build Web Applications**](https://andregarzia.com/2025/06/experimenting-with-no-build-web-applications.html) as a reminder that the plethora of tools we use in web development are there to solve specific issues, and not actually required. Always a good idea to be conscious about which dependencies we bring into our projects and why.

- Syntax discussing the [different **browsers** and rendering engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RecFUQ7eQKU) that we have in 2025.

- [Need a quick favicon?](https://fav.farm/)

- [HTTP Cats](https://http.cat/) ðŸ˜»

### Notable releases:

- [**Nuxt 4.0**](https://nuxt.com/blog/v4), Vue's meta-framework, with various stability- and quality-of-life-related updates. Appreciate their approach to releases: _"In general, we aim for a hype-free approach to releases."_

- [**Prettier 3.6**](https://prettier.io/blog/2025/06/23/3.6.0), coming with a new, experimental CLI that promises to be much faster.

- [**Oxlint 1.0**](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-oxlint-1-stable), a fast and easy to use linter from the Vite team. Keeping a close eye on this one because it seems to be the best candidate for replacing ESLint eventually ðŸ‘€

- [**Vite 7.0**](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite7), again with performance and stability improvements, as well as changing the default browser target to [Baseline Widely Available.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility#baseline_badges) Is [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist) still a thing at this point?

- [**Git 2.50**](https://github.blog/open-source/git/highlights-from-git-2-50/)---can't say I really understand all of the updates here, but merging now uses a different algorithm that is a lot faster, so I'll take it.

- [**Deno 2.4**](https://deno.com/blog/v2.4), bringing back bundling for frontend and backend code.

- [**Edit**](https://github.com/microsoft/edit), _"a simple text editor for simple needs"_, e.g. when you need to edit stuff in the terminal but can't be bothered with Vim.
