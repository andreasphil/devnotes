title: State of CSS, gradient blur, text fragments
---

- **State of CSS & HTML 2024:** The results of the yearly [CSS](https://stateofcss.com/en-US/) and [HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/en-US) surveys are out! These are always great to learn about new APIs and tools that are picking up pace. Especially CSS has been on a run recently: 'Let me make a prediction: we'll look back at 2024 as the turning point between "CSS Classic" and "New CSS".' Agreed!

- This neat **gradient blur effect in a few lines of CSS,** combining [`mask`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask) + [`backdrop-filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter): [Codepen](https://codepen.io/QuiteQuinn/pen/jOBxGjr)

- Center stuff in a single line of CSS? Now finally possible with [`align-content: center;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content) üéâ

- [**Text fragments**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments) allow you to link to a specific piece of text on a page and highlight it. It's similar to `#`, except that this is a browser feature and does not require the website to implement anything. [Try it!](https://digitalservice.bund.de/projekte/neues-rechtsinformationssystem/#:~:text=der%20-OpenBundesregierung)

- **Lefthook,** the Git hooks manager we use in many projects, can also be used for [general tasks outside of Git hooks.](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook?tab=readme-ov-file#your-own-tasks) Might be handy to unify commands across different stacks and setups! It also supports [local overrides.](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook?tab=readme-ov-file#local-config)

- **Vue Dev Tools** are getting a [huge update](https://devtools-next.vuejs.org/getting-started/features) (urgently needed tbh). Interestingly it's in the form of a Vite plugin, not a browser extension, meaning they can be embedded directly on the page. Should be great for debugging across browsers and devices.

- **Promise.try:** This [new API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/try) offers an alternative to try/catch. Nothing you couldn't do before but can help you write more compact or uniform code in some situations. Browser support is currently limited, but should be available everywhere soon.

- [**System things:**](https://css-tricks.com/system-things/) Did you know you can use system colors like `Canvas` and `LinkText` in CSS? Not incredibly fancy, but adapts automatically to the user's system and preferences (like dark mode and contrast). I created a small [page](https://andreasphil.github.io/system-colors/) where you can see all of them. Related: This [list of font stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/) that work without downloading additional fonts.

- If I got you excited about **symbols** last time, here is a great explainer: [Exploring JavaScript symbols](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/symbols-in-javascript)

- Love this idea: [Using static websites for tiny archives](https://alexwlchan.net/2024/static-websites/)

- macOS has a built-in internet speed test that you can run from the terminal: `networkQuality`, along with some other [helpful tools.](https://weiyen.net/articles/useful-macos-cmd-line-utilities/)
