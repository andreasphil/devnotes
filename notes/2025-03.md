title: Interop, customizable select, vanilla JS date formatting
---

- **Interop 2025** is the yearly initiative by the major browser vendors to make various new or existing features of the web platform work consistently everywhere. Among other things, [this year](https://webkit.org/blog/16458/announcing-interop-2025/) we're getting [anchor positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) and [view transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) üéâ

- Did you know you can [reorder commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) during **interactive rebase** by simply reordering the lines in the editor?

- The [**customizable select**](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/a-customizable-select?hl=en) is stable in Chrome! No timeline on implementation in Firefox or WebKit yet, but since it degrades gracefully, we should be able to cautiously use it already today.

- **Design mode:** setting `document.designMode = "on"` via the console [will make any page editable.](https://smashingmagazine.com/2025/03/previewing-content-changes-work-documentdesignmode/) Useful for quickly testing text manipulations, removing stuff and other small edits.

- Here's a little cheatsheet for [**formatting dates with vanilla JavaScript.**](https://henry.codes/writing/human-readable-date-formatting-with-vanilla-javascript)

- Node.js has added [**utilities for coloring console logs.**](https://pawelgrzybek.com/node-js-added-utility-for-text-formatting-you-may-not-need-chalk-anymore/) Another instance of a thing people commonly installed libraries for being moved to the platform. Did you know you can [style console logs in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#outputting_text_to_the_console:~:text=me%205%20times.-,styling%20console%20output,-You%20can%20use) using CSS, too?

- **Tailwind Play:** there is a [fully functioning Tailwind distribution](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) that can be included in a script tag without any build steps. Probably not what you'd want in a production app, but might be useful for prototypes or small projects.

- **ESLint is iterating their new config format**, including adding a `defineConfig` helper to get better TypeScript support. Confusingly they're also [re-introducing `extends`](https://eslint.org/blog/2025/03/flat-config-extends-define-config-global-ignores/), supposedly one of the worst sources of complexity and a major reason for developing the new format in the first place. Another round on the [frontend treadmill](https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/) I guess. As with anything ESLint does, it made me wonder if Biome or Oxlint [have become viable alternatives in the meantime.](https://medium.com/ekino-france/is-biome-ready-to-replace-prettier-eslint-94d56d5aa33f) They don't seem to be there just yet, but [progress has been made.](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html)

- **Corepack will be removed from Node.js:** if you know what Corepack is, [this](https://socket.dev/blog/node-js-tsc-votes-to-stop-distributing-corepack) is good to know. If the word Corepack doesn't mean anything to you, there's no reason to find out anymore üòÑ

- **Next.js has been getting some bad press** lately, including reports on [horrible performance outside of Vercel](https://martijnhols.nl/blog/how-much-traffic-can-a-pre-rendered-nextjs-site-handle) and other [vendor lock-in](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/), along with a [really bad security flaw](https://zeropath.com/blog/nextjs-middleware-cve-2025-29927-auth-bypass) that they apparently also handled poorly. Luckily for us we don't use Next.js anyawy (as far as I'm aware ü§î). So we can add this to the list of reasons to keep it that way.

- A **talk about software quality and simplicity (or lack thereof)** with lots of fascinating examples about technology knowledge that has been lost over time: [Preventing the Collapse of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko)

- I was looking for a new system to organize my notes and came across [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/), which looked interesting and indeed quite organized. I ended up in the other extreme, dumping everything into [One Big Text File](https://mikegrindle.com/posts/obtf) instead. Let me know if personal knowledge management and productivity are interesting to you---would love to chat! C&C maybe? ‚òïÔ∏è
