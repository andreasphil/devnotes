title: AI skepticism, Safari 26, Remix waking up
---

- [**My AI skeptic friends are all nuts:**](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) As an AI-skeptic myself, this post gave me some food for thought. I played around with agent mode and Claude 4 in Zed the other day, and that much I can say already: it's absolutely a different Hausnummer than Copilot clumsily autocompleting my code a few months ago.

- During **WWDC**, Apple [announced](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/233/) a bunch of features coming to Safari ~~19~~ 26. My personal favorites: [anchor positioning](https://css-tricks.com/css-anchor-positioning-guide/), [scroll-driven animations](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/scroll-driven-animations), and the [URLPattern API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) You can find the full list on the [WebKit blog.](https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta/)

- VS Code now shows the [**baseline support status of CSS features.**](https://web.dev/blog/baseline-vscode?hl=en) It is also getting an official [**PostgreSQL extension**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648) for building and exploring databases that integrates with Copilot.

- In the latest episode of React: Tag und Nacht, **Remix,** the popular React-framework that has recently been merged into React Router, ["woke up"](https://remix.run/blog/wake-up-remix) to be an entirely different framework based on a fork of [Preact.](https://preactjs.com) The community is... not excited ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/1kxld0a/wake_up_remix_but_still_ditch_react/?chainedPosts=t3_1kro9ck), [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44116341)). My personal take: their stated principles sound promising, and I appreciate the experimentation. But I don't trust the authors to keep this stable for long enough that it would be a good foundation for any project that intends to be around for a while. Thoughts?

- Last month I mentioned that Firefox has shipped the new **Temporal API.** If you haven't heard about it before, here's a good [overview](https://waspdev.com/articles/2025-05-24/temporal-api) of what it does.

- Ever wondered why some types of collections support `forEach` but not other array methods such as `map`? That's because they implement the iterator protocol, which so far hasn't supported anything else. Fortunately, that has now changed: [**Iterator helpers have become Baseline Newly Available**](https://web.dev/blog/baseline-iterator-helpers)

- [**gum**](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) is a neat little tool if you write shell scripts but also want ‚ú®fancy‚ú®

- [**Invoker commands**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) are a declarative way for showing popups, dialogs, and more. You can also register your own commands! This should make handling many common interactions in web UIs simpler. Chrome-only for now, but all other major browsers are actively working on implementing the spec.

### Notable releases:

- [**Storybook 9.0**](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-9/), with huge improvements in bundle size and installed dependencies, along with better testing tools. They offer a migration tool that worked flawlessly for [RIS UI.](https://github.com/digitalservicebund/ris-ui/pull/245) Here's an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QRzlQbUHcc) with one of the engineers if you want to hear more.

- [**Angular 20**](https://blog.angular.dev/announcing-angular-v20-b5c9c06cf301) continues to modernize and improve the framework with signals, reworking their rendering model, improved template syntax, and more. I haven't worked with Angular in years, but it looks like they're busy fixing all the things I didn't like about it back then. Definitely keeping an eye on it!

- You can now try [**Rolldown Vite**](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-rolldown-vite), the next generation of Vite with a completely rewritten bundler.

- [**es-toolkit**](https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.39.0), a popular alternative to lodash, is now 100% lodash compatible.

- [**JSPM 4.0**](https://jspm.org/jspm-4.0-release), a different take on package management for the frontend that builds on web standards. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm intrigued.
