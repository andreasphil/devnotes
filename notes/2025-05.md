title: Dotfiles, new JavaScript APIs, Generators
---

- I recently set up a new computer and was reminded how great [dotfiles](https://github.com/andreasphil/dotfiles) are. Feel free to share yours ðŸ˜Š One thing I already learned from @Christian is that you can [configure many macOS settings](https://macos-defaults.com) from the terminal!

- [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a linter for shell scripts that helps you write more robust scripts and avoid common mistakes.

- New JavaScript APIs that might make your life easier:

  - [`RegExp.escape`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/escape) escapes potential regex syntax characters in a string
  - [`Error.isError`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/isError) checks if something is an error without weird edge cases
  - [`Array.with`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/with) copies an array and replaces an item at an index in one go (handy for immutable state updates)
  - [`Promise.withResolvers`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/withResolvers) more convenient and modern syntax for creating promises

- [Do we still need CSS pre- and post-processors?](https://css-tricks.com/so-you-want-to-give-up-css-pre-and-post-processors/) I don't think so. I would go as far as saying that I would at least consider not using Tailwind either when starting a new project. Plain CSS, light component-level encapsulation (like Vue's scoping), and some conventions like [CUBE](https://cube.fyi) seems more appealing to me than dependencies and breaking changes at this point.

- [React Server Confusion](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2025/apr/8/react-server-confusion/) formulates some fair criticism of React server components. Fun fact: the first and only time I touched them was my coding assignment for DS. But from my limited experience, this rings true:

> The issue is the tradeoffs involved in making it work. It leaks into, or even demands control over layers that are previously not in scope for client-side frameworks. This creates heavy complexity [...] React team made a bet that they can work with Next team to polish the DX to the extent that the benefit would essentially be free [...]. IMO, that bet has failed.

- ["I think the ergonomics of generators is growing on me"](https://macarthur.me/posts/generators/)---same here, though I rarely use them. This is a good read if you're curious about iterators and generators.

- After @Dennis recommendation last month, I've started using [Zed](https://zed.dev) and enjoy it! It's fast, looks great, and easy to get used to when coming from VS Code. It finds a good balance between supporting AI features but not [shoving them in your face.](https://zed.dev/blog/out-of-your-face-ai) I particularly like the Vim mode, which has many Vim features but aligns better with my expectations for a modern text editor.

- Some people are saying Deno is in [decline.](https://dbushell.com/2025/04/28/denos-decline/) Deno, naturally, [disagrees.](https://deno.com/blog/greatly-exaggerated) The [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44040332) around it is instructive, because it highlights Denoâ€™s capabilities and community expectations vs. the companyâ€™s goals. Personally, Iâ€™ve switched back to Node.js + NPM, which have improved a lot thanks to competition from other runtimes.
