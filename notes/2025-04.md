title: State of Vue, visual effects in CSS, Temporal API
---

Starting with insights from the **[State of Vue 2025](https://www.monterail.com/stateofvue) report:** beyond the usual popularity surveys (Vue continues to thrive) the report includes case studies, core team interviews, and some stats I hadn't seen before:

- Most Vue developers have 4+ years of experience with the framework, and nearly all would choose it again for future projects---says something about the quality to have such a loyal community ‚ú®
- Single page applications remain the dominant architecture in the Vue ecosystem, despite recent industry shifts away from SPAs. The Vue team is aware of that and say they have no intentions to become opinionated about servers or otherwise changing their scope.
- No plans for a V4 or breaking changes. Instead, the Vue team is focusing on performance improvements and stability through internal refactoring, as well as Vapor Mode.

Other things that caught my attention:

- **Experimenting with visual effects in CSS:** I love the animated gradient in the [footer of the Rocycle website](https://rocyclestudios.com/en), so I "view source"-ed a bit to learn how it's implemented. Turns out it's quite simple: It combines a canvas, two colorful circles and some clever math for a very nice visual effect. I re-created it using CSS, which was a great opportunity to play with some modern CSS features such as [`@property`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property), [`sin()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sin), and [container queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/), in addition to web components and [Alpine.js.](https://alpinejs.dev/) It only takes 1/4th of the code of the original canvas-based implementation---a great reminder of how powerful CSS has become. You can find the result on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreasphil/spin) if you're curious. Please be gentle with the demo, I did not try very hard to make it robust üò¨

- Looks like Chrome won't be [removing **3rd party cookies**](https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/) after all.

- Some food for thought: [**The skill of the future is not 'AI', but 'Focus'**](https://www.carette.xyz/posts/focus_will_be_the_skill_of_the_future/) (interesting [discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744394), too)

- [**TAC (tags, attributes, classes)**](https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology), a CSS methodology that relies on custom tags and attributes for almost all the styling. I like the idea because it looks clean and more component-y.

- Continuing with cool CSS-based visuals, **over-engineering [frosted glass](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/backdrop-filter/)** is one of my favorite UI styles, and these **[CSS-only blurred image placeholders](https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/)** blow my mind ü§Ø

- A [**negative animation delay**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay) will start the animation at the point as if that time has already passed, e.g. an animation of `2s` with a delay of `-1s` starts the animation at `50%`. Useful if you have multiple of the same animation on one page and don't want them all to be in sync.

- The **[Node.js util](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilpromisifyoriginal) `promisify`** turns functions that take callbacks into nice modern promises.

- [Eyecons](https://eyecons.dev/) is an **icon pack for VS Code** that automatically adapts to your color scheme.

- [Kill the newsletter](http://localhost:8000/), a free service that **converts email newsletters into RSS feeds.**

- Firefox is the first browser to [ship the new **Temporal API**](https://spidermonkey.dev/blog/2025/04/11/shipping-temporal.html) (a.k.a `Date` but [good](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/javascript-temporal-is-coming/)). Still a long way to go before this will be usable, but great to see some progress.
